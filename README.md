## Yet another Backpack mod for Fabric, NeoForge and Forge, to get more Inventory space.
___

Resource Backpacks is a MultiLoader Mod built for Fabric, NeoForge and Forge.<br>
All Backpacks can be equipped in the Chest slot and can be opened by pressing ``B`` or use the right-click when the Backpack is in your Main/Off-Hand.
You can also have your Backpack inside your Inventory, that also can be opened via the ``B`` Keybind.

### Configuration
The Size of your Backpacks are Configurable within the ``config/resource_backpacks.toml`` file, which is located inside your game directory.
The only exception is the Ender Backpack for obvious reasons.

### Compatibility
Resource Backpacks aims to be compatible with most of the mainly used Accessories Mods.<br>
When no Trinket/Accessory Mod is installed you can equip the Backpack in your Chestslot, this is also the only
way in Forge, because there is currently no known Accessory Mod available.
